# 🛰️ Satellite-Image-Classification
🚀 Satellite Image Classification (EuroSAT + Ai Model)  This repository trains a CNN (ResNet18) to classify EuroSAT satellite images into 10 land-cover classes. It includes training, evaluation, plots, sample predictions and an animated GIF demo.

## 🚩 Purpose
This repository demonstrates a **practical pipeline** to classify land cover from satellite imagery using deep learning (on the EuroSAT dataset). The goal is to show how AI can be applied to **real aerospace tasks** such as remote sensing, UAV/aircraft terrain awareness, and satellite onboard analytics.

**Key idea:** take satellite image tiles → run a trained CNN → get land-cover labels → use results for mapping, monitoring, or decision support.

## 🔎 Practical Uses & How It Fits Aerospace
This project is directly relevant to aerospace / aircraft programs in the following ways:

- **Earth observation & satellite missions**  
  - Automate land-cover mapping from satellite imagery for environmental monitoring, crop monitoring, and urban studies.
- **UAV / Drone operations**  
  - Real-time terrain classification for flight planning (identify safe landing zones, avoid restricted/unsafe terrain).
- **Aircraft safety & airspace management**  
  - Enhance situational awareness with updated land-cover maps, useful for emergency landing decisions or route planning.
- **Disaster response & humanitarian aid**  
  - Rapid classification to detect flooded zones, burned areas, or damaged infrastructure following natural disasters.

**Practical workflow example**
1. Acquire imagery (satellite tiles or UAV images).  
2. Preprocess (resize, normalize, georeference).  
3. Run the classifier (batch or real-time inference).  
4. Postprocess: aggregate tile labels into maps, overlay on GIS, trigger alerts or human review.  
5. Integrate outputs into flight control systems, mission planners, or monitoring dashboards.
